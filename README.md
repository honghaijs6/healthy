### ABOUT TEST ###
First of all I would like to thank the company for giving me the opportunity to take this test, it is also an interesting challenge that I have experienced,

1/ the first problem, is the level of layout design I really like this layout template it's beautiful and not too difficult for me. exception 1 Component Chart

2/ Layout responsive issue, its not quite hard but need careful, and take time
 
3/ The Chart Component issues , really a challenge, I've been looking into the sample libraries, but after a while I realized, I don't need them, and build my own Chart, that would be nicer. i discover a little SVG tags and how to draw it, then write out a graph, the next steps just adding it more interaction to show out onto Circle progress bar

4/ then done ^^
